## **About**

The [bingo] project was produced using React.js, Redux technology. The bingo game consists of two players, and each player's bingo table is shuffleed. 

Bingo game rules, where the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines are marked in a row, increase the number of bingo times, and the complete bingo list is displayed on the screen in order. 

This bingo game is composed of two players, but logic is implemented so that users can operate without major modification even if they increase.
